# Online Store
This online store is built to display and track product inventory, actively build a cart and checkout to purchase merchandise.

## User Stories
- As a user, I would like to see all products displayed at one time so that I can easily browse
- As a user, I want the option to remove items that I am no longer interested in as needed to avoid accidentally making a that purchase I do not want.
- As a user, I would like to receive an itemized receipt showing my purchase total as well as how much each item cost to easily track spending
- As a user, I want the option to add items that I am interested in purchasing to my cart until I am ready for checkout
- As a user, I would like to have all of my items and their prices displayed in my cart before I checkout so that I easily determine what I want to keep and how much it would cost
